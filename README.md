# Crisis-Map-using-django-and-google-map
As a semester project of DataBase course(winter-2015, D.r. Shiri)
              we wanted to write an app for information collection, visualisation, and interactive mapping.<br>
              This website can collect eyewitness reports of disaster reported by android app or webpage and place them on a Google Maps map publicly.<br>
              These kinds of softwares offer products that enable local observers to submit reports using their mobile phones or the internet, while simultaneously creating a temporal and geospatial archive of events.<br>
              In crisis categories there are practical examples like Ushahidi, and in other fields such as public transportation we know Uber and many others.
